          Iâ€™m Molly, a junior web developer, born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand. I have been interested in tech and have had persistent desire to learn since I can remember. 
          Recently tipped over the edge by targeted advertising, a pandemic and a desire to change my career trajectory, I decided to investigate coding. <br/><br/>

          Over the past year I have been dedicated to learning how to code and create applications. Starting with a University course with a focus on Java and frontend technologies, 
          I was gripped by frontend. Since, I have become most interested in React, CSS frameworks (tailwind and bootstrap), Javascript, Express and Node.js. <br/><br/>

          My goal is to become a valuable Full-stack developer, able to take great ideas to improve peoples lives and turn them into well executed applications. <br/><br/>

          In my spare time I enjoy getting outside and exploring, playing/watching rollerderby, rock climbing, reading and board games. <br/>
